晚上好呀，Echo.
今天是跟你分开的第一天( ´▽｀)嘻嘻，我记得牢吧？乖不乖？
Even it's the first day we are seperated , it feels like we are soooo far away from each other
Sometimes I would wonder if that's all a dream , for you and for me.
Waiting is a hard task, and even more harder when it's between you and me 
I am trying to grab up all myself and stick all my peices together cause I know, no one can save me until I honor a redemption myself
I am learning and growing , and I understand you'd love to protect me , but I'm not going to quit myself from trying
pain will force me to grow
and I know you tried to protect me from pain
but whatever, growth isn't comfortable from the first time when it was called 'growth'
I am quite lazy these days , trying to return to a normal life sequence , trying to focus on the things that I was told 'I should do' in the society 
But I of course accidently ( nope , absolutly ) failed to return to a normal life. 
It's not rejecting ... it's just a kind of habit , habit of my brain trying to be closer to a better and more beneficial topic ---- but unfortunately I can't allow myself to continue doing that cause I am a human
Sometimes the lines between a dumb or a genius is too vague, who knows am I a genius or a dumb who always love imagining everything around myself?
Sometimes imaginations will seem to be real when we start to offer them enough details. To much imagination will make me feel realistic, and I tried so hard to avoid this
From my heart I am truly scared that I woulb be a madman, cause I've seen sooo many times, on TV or movies... when a madman stuck in there dreams but can't recognize himself
I carefully control my imagination to not to be a madman , but sometimes I just wonder,
who knows? who knows if I am in a dream or not ?
Even if I am really that kind of madman, why should I really care for the possible strange gaze from various people?
If I am already stucked inside, if I am already slept and all my core and my logic is connected and make sense----
Madmen won't discover themselves as madmen, only people who can't find a stable logic system will lose their path.
